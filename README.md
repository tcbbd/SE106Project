# SE106Project
SJTU SE106 data structure course project

A weibo like Windows console application imitating social network apps using B-tree,
cross-linklist and binary heap as database data structure. It uses Windows API to explicitly 
control the cursor and characters so that the terminal UI would be more like the web UI.
